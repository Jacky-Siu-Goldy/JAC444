I had trouble figuring out how to decrypt the encrypted 4 digits string. Lucky I went to the lab otherwise i wouldn't have know how to do it.
I also did not know i was not suppose to use the command line to input the 4 digits string. After the professor told me that i am suppose to allow 
for user input using Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in); String something = scan.nextLine(); I was able to correct that mistake.
