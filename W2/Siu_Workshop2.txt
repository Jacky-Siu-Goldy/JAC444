In this workshop I learned how to import a class that is from a different package. I also learned
how to declare a class array. For example I want to declare an object array from the class
GroceryItemOrder. I need to do this GroceryItemOrder[] groceryList = new GroceryItemOrder[10];
And then I got to initialize it for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
						groceryList[i] = new GroceryItemOrder("", 0, 0.00);
					  }
in the default constructor of the class GroceryList. I learned how to calculate the totals of the
columns and rows of a two dimensional array. lets say you have a two dimensional array
private double[][] saleRecordTable = new double [4][5]; 0 to <4 is each individual element of the row
you do two for loop. This is only part of the code.
for(int i = 0; i < 5 ; i++) {
	for (int a = 0; a < 4; a++) {
		personProductRow[i].append(rightPadding(saleRecordTable[a][i], ch, 8));
		totalSaleOfEachProduct += saleRecordTable[a][i];
	}
}
The outer for loop you iterate through the number of each row 0 to <5.
In the inner for loop you iterate from 0 to <4. this is how you line up 
each element of a row and tally up the total.
Similarly if you want to tally up the total of each column the outer
for loop should be 0 to <4 and the inner for loop should be 0 to <5
like this
for(int a = 0; a < 4; a++) {
	double totalSaleOfEachPerson = 0.00;
	   for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
				
	   	totalSaleOfEachPerson += saleRecordTable[a][i];
	   }
			
}
That way you can line up each element in a column to calculates its total.
