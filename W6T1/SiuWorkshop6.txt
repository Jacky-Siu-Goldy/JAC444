I ran into trouble creating javadoc and don't know how to fix it.
Beside that creating program for workshop 6 task1 and task2
required a lot of thought and it took me more than a week
to figure out how to do it. Figuring out how to change the
stage and pane and scene took alot of searching on the internet.
Figuring out the regular expression also took a lot of time.
It took me sometime to figure out I need a play trigger for
the game guess the number, so that when I press play again 
it restarts the game. Also initializing the random number
and changing the random number when the game finish before another
game start. That part was tricky. Integrating other separate class's method
from to a normal java file into the a button event handler in the controller
took some getting  use to familiarize yourself with how it is done.
