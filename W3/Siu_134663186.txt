In this workshop i learned how to use abstraction to generalize code at the top
of the inheritance pyramid and avoid code duplication further down the chain
of the inheritance hierarchy. This allow for flexibility for any changes in inherited
behavior you want to incorporate into the child that is similar but different
from the parent. 

There is something i am confuse about does a child of a child need to implement
a method that has be declare an abstract method in the abstract class at the top 
of inheritance, if the child of the superclass already implement it? I 
experiment with that question and find out that The child of
a child of the superclass, I find doesn't necessary have to implement a method 
that has been declared an abstract method, if its parent the child of the superclass
already implemented it. In that case you only need to implement it if you want the 
child's method to override the parent method, otherwise you can leave it as it is and 
the program will run.
