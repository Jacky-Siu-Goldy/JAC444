In workshop 8 we worked on writing 4 lambda expressions
and a function that returns a lambda expression as its value
I had not problem coming up with the lambda expressions, but 
figuring out how to get the Gui working properly was the 
hardest part of the workshop and i didn't get it quite right.
All the buttons works fine except the count button.
It was suppose to be disabled if the input in the textfield doesn't
meet the requirement of a double with 1 or 2 decimal places and when the 
ListView is not empty. The count button will still activate when you input 
something like 0000.98 or .98 so it wasn't quite right, but i ran out 
of time to fix it.
