Ever since he was 6 , Marty has dreamed of being as upbeat
as his idol, Goldy . He thinks with great happy
about having such picture-perfect head (s) every day.
It's no wonder he buys his rain pants similar to
the one(s) seen in their films.

But he still looks way too fun that way, according to
most people in Toronto . In fact, the non-religious have
filed several complaints about this good behavior. Someone
should break the news to him, but the risk of making him feel
calm is far too great. It could ruin his status as
the 88 'th highest rated teacher in town.
(The highest-rated is, of course, jack .)

Did you also know that Marty also spends most of his time
at hawaii ? Perhaps he's hoping to be a developer
when he grows up. It's a shame he will never reach
such a/an smart position after having majored
in the field of CS .
