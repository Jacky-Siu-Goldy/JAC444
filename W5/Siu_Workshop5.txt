In this workshop I created a computerized version of the game Mad Libs.
I had a lot of difficulty figure out how to capture the token using Regex,
but finally i figure out what was causing the problem was ^ (begin) and $(end);
The text that comes from the file has been appended into a single block of String, that's
is why regex with ^ and $ won't work. That is just my guess.
so I did it like this "(<([a-zA-Z'-]+)>)", the inside bracket is group(2) allows
me to capture the inside of the token < >, at the same time capture the whole token,
and have inputted word or phrase take its place.
Originally I used Scanner(file), while something.hasNextLine() and something.nextLine
to read the file. The problem is that it doesn't capture the newLine character
so everything appear in a single line when appended. It was solved at first by appending 
a newLine character right after a line of text from the file had been appended. This created
another problem what if the last line of the text doesn't have a newLine character at the end,
you would have been appending a newLine character wrongly. This problem was solved after
I searched online and I discovered Files.readString(path). It reads the whole text with out using
a while loop, and best of all it capture the newLine character as well.
